# Credit Card Fraud Detection in R
Credit card fraud is the most common type of identity fraud, and businesses are desperate to find a solution to stop the loss it creates. A recent study by Juniper Research has found that retailers are expected to lose $130 billion in digital CNP (Card-not-Present) fraud between 2018 and 2023. Businesses need to be able to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, and machine learning could be a solution.

This project will examine how machine learning algorithms can be used to predict if a credit card transaction from the data set is fraudulent or not. Multiple data resampling methods will be used on the imbalanced data to train a machine learning model, and the results will be compared. A single resampling method will then be chosen and used on the imbalanced data to fit multiple machine learning models, and the model with the best ROC performance on the test set will be identified. Variable importance for a given model will be determined, which will show which features are the most important predictors for the model. Finally, an ensemble model will be created to combine the predictions of different models. The tools in the caret package will be used to handle the entire process of training, testing, predicting, and comparing the machine learning models in this project.
